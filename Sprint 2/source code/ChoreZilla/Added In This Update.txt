This is the combined version of my and Jonas' work

- Registration fields are tied to variables
- Necessary checks during registration are made
  *If username exists
  *If passwords are the same
  *If all fields are filled out
- SignIn checks against files to see if username exists before logging in
- SignIn tells user to register if the username is not found
- Combined my and Jonas' components

Not done at this point
* Remember Me checkbox needs implementation
* SignIn doesn't parse for password check yet
* Where in the hell do the files physically go?!
